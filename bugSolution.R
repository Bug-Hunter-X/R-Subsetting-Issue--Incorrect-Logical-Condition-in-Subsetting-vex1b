```r
# This R code demonstrates the correct way to subset a data frame based on a condition, resolving the unexpected results from the incorrect logical condition in the original code.

df <- data.frame(a = c(1, 2, 3), b = c(4, 5, 6))

# Correct subsetting using the subset function
subset_df_correct <- subset(df, a == 1 | a == 3)

# Correct subsetting using the '[' operator and which
subset_df_correct2 <- df[which(df$a == 1 | df$a == 3), ]

# Correct subsetting using the '[' operator directly and logical indexing
subset_df_correct3 <- df[df$a == 1 | df$a == 3, ]

#Another example with AND operator 
subset_df_correct4 <- df[df$a == 1 & df$b == 4, ]

# Print the results
print(subset_df_correct)
print(subset_df_correct2)
print(subset_df_correct3)
print(subset_df_correct4)
