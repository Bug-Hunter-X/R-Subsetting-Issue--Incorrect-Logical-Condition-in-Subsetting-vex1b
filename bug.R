```r
# This R code attempts to subset a data frame based on a condition, but it produces unexpected results due to an error in how the logical condition is specified.

df <- data.frame(a = c(1, 2, 3), b = c(4, 5, 6))

# Incorrect subsetting
subset_df <- df[df$a == 1 | df$a == 3, ]

# The condition `df$a == 1 | df$a == 3` creates a logical vector, but if you intend to subset rows where 'a' is either 1 OR 3, the condition is correct, but if you intend to subset rows where 'a' is either 1 AND 3, then the condition is wrong, it should be `df$a == 1 & df$a == 3` which is always FALSE, the intended result will never be obtained.

# Correct subsetting 
subset_df_correct <- subset(df, a==1 | a==3)

# Another correct subsetting using which
subset_df_correct2 <- df[which(df$a == 1 | df$a == 3), ]

# Print the results
print(subset_df)
print(subset_df_correct)
print(subset_df_correct2)
